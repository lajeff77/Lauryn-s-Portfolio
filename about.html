    <!--About me-->
    <div id="about">
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Lauryn Jefferson. I am a 4th year computer science undergraduate at San Diego State University with an honors minor in interdisciplinary studies. I make art with programming and I will change the world through code. </p>
        <h2>Where did I start?</h2>
        <p>In middle school I had a 3DS. I downloaded a game from the Eshop called Petit Computer. It brought an adaptaion of the programming language BASIC called SmileBASIC to the 3DS allowing people to code games on the handheld. I knew nothing of programming and was instantly intruiged. 
            The manual for the language was poorly translated and hard to follow for beginning programmers, so I decided to learn another language from the internet and apply my knowledge to SmileBASIC. I continued to learn more and more languages like C, Java, Javascript and Python on my own.
            Pretty soon, I ended up spending weekends and breaks learning as much as I could. When I got to high school, my school introuduced two computer science courses. I immediately locked both into my future coursework schedule. After anticpating taking the introductory class that my school offered for 
            over a year, I was finally able to take it. I learned C in the introudctory course. The next year I learned Java in the AP course. For all these years since middle school, I had been trying to make something tangible out of the coding I had learned. In the summer of 2017, after I graduted high school
            I finally had all the tools I needed to produce my first game called Shoot 'Em Up, a small space shooter game. That project was 5 years in the making and it remains the project I am most proud of because I wanted to achieve something, and I never stopped for 5 whole years.</p>
        <h2>Where am I now?</h2>
        <p>Since I made my first game, I continued to create more games and applications, mostly with the Java programming language. I started college and learned more about coding and computers through my major. 
            I've had amazing oppportunities such as pariticipating in an REU program at Carnegie Mellon for Human Computer Interaction, and interning for the finacial tech company Intuit. I continued to make art through code 
            through my side projects.</p>
        <h2>Why is coding my passion?</h2>
            <p>I am an artist. My programs are more than just code to me. They're a creative outlet. Whenver I work on a project I like to see the whole creative process through. I want to learn design and make sure my projects look good. When appropriate I also want to compose the music and design the sounds
                associated with my projects. Being in complete control over the creation of a program excites me the most, whether it be a website, game, mobile app, or desktop application. I take pride in being responsible for the whole vision and execution of a program. 
            </p>
        <h2>Why the website?</h2>
        <p>Like a painter or a designer, I want to have one central collection of all of my best coding projects and creations or a portfolio. On this website, I showcase solo projects with things I have learned both in and outside of the classroom.</p>
